## Functions

In this small app, I design several basic functions for data--search, add, delete
For search part, user can search all data in database, either through user name or model
After users login using google, they can insert data and delete data(for data belongs to user only)

For data analysis content there is no content, but if I have more spare time in the future, I want to implement some interesting functions.
